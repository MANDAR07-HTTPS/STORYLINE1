                 He was born at Shivneri which is a hill fort in Junnar in Poona, now known as Pune. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took birth into a family of bureaucrats. His father Shahji Bhonsale was a great Maratha general in the army of Bijapur Sultanate and his mother Jijabai was a great devotee of religion. And at the age of 16 Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took the oath of Hindavi Swarajya at the Raireshwar temple in Bhor, Maharashtra on Chaitra Shu in 1645, with Lord Raereshwar and some of his friends(Mavale) as a witness.
